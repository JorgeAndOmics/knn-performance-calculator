# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Performance Calculator

This script provides a comprehensive solution for evaluating the performance of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm on a given dataset. The script is implemented in Python and makes use of the following libraries:

-   Numpy
-   Pandas
-   Matplotlib
-   Scikit-learn

## Features

The script offers several functions that help in evaluating the performance of KNN algorithm:

-   `determine_k_knn`: Determines the optimal value of k for KNN algorithm using cross-validation.
-   `grid_search_knn`: Uses grid search to determine the optimal value of k for KNN algorithm.
-   `elbow_method_knn`: Uses the elbow method to determine the optimal value of k for KNN algorithm.
-   `plot_knn_performance`: Plots the performance of KNN algorithm for a given value of k.
-   `export_results`: Exports the results of KNN evaluation in a format that can be easily imported into other tools.
-   `batch_process_knn`: Performs a batch process for multiple datasets to determine the optimal value of k for KNN algorithm.
-   `search_knn`: Performs a search against a variety of datasets to determine the optimal value of k for KNN algorithm.

## Usage

The script can be run using the `main` function, which loads a dataset, determines the optimal value of k using the elbow method, plots the performance of KNN algorithm for the optimal value of k, exports the results of KNN evaluation, performs a batch process for multiple datasets, and performs a search against a variety of datasets.

## Requirements

-   Python 3.x
-   Numpy
-   Pandas
-   Matplotlib
-   Scikit-learn
